<abstract>This GIS data set represents the Florida shoreline as polygons and lines. Initially digitized in 1990 by USFWS under FWRI contract, the data set was created from the most current National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Nautical Charts available at the time. The scale of the source charts varied from 1:10,000 in some harbors to 1:80,000 in the Big Bend area. However, most of the source scale is 1:40,000. The current data set is the result of revisions to the 1990 version. Some areas, including inland areas where there is no chart coverage and areas that have needed more accuracy for individual projects, have been digitized from USGS 7.5-minute Quadrangles and Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQs).</abstract>
<purpose>This data set represents the Florida Shoreline at a 1:40,000 scale in vector format.</purpose>
<supplinf>Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information. The source scale varies from 1:10,000 to 1:80,000.</supplinf>

<procdesc>This Florida shoreline was originally digitized in 1990 by USFWS under FWRI contract. In all cases, USFWS used the most detailed NOAA navigational charts available at the time (i.e. harbor areas were taken from 1:10000 and the Big Bend was taken from 1:80000). In some areas, nautical charts were insufficient and 1:24000 USGS quadrangles or DOQQs were used instead of the nautical charts. This is especially true along rivers.</procdesc>

<procdesc>FWRI staff updated the linework in Miami-Dade County to include linework digitized in-house for manatee speed zones and another project. Only major shoreline linework was edited, as well as some interior canalwork that was important for the manatee speed zones. The revised linework was edgematched to the 1:40,000 shoreline linework, so that no interior canals were lost. The new linework and polygon attributes have been verified against 1999 DOQQs.</procdesc>
